# YIACO

is an innovative car parking application designed to offer users a seamless parking experience. The app allows customers to request a valet driver, who will receive their car, park it in a designated parking area, and return it upon the customerâ€™s request. Customers can easily send a message through the app to notify the valet when they are ready to have their car brought back. The application has two versions: one for customers and one for drivers (valets). Both versions are managed through a central dashboard, providing full control over parking requests, driver assignments, and real-time updates. Each car is linked to a unique barcode for easy identification and tracking, ensuring security and efficient management. To ensure data protection and user security, the app includes robust data encryption and user authentication features, offering a safe and trustworthy experience for all users.
